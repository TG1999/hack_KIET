<h3>Problem : Loss of 'golden hour' due to Conjusted traffic</h3>
<p>
 It is a well-known fact that the first hour immediately following a road accident,
  otherwise known as the ‘golden hour’, is crucial to determining the chances of survival.<b>  Solution : With the ability to control the flow of traffic 
  we can provide a steady path for the first responders to fullfill their responsibilites without any delays</b>.

<h3>Problem : Combating driver-fatigue</h3>
<p>
Driver impairment due to drowsiness and fatigue is known to be a major contributing factor in thousands of truck crashes each year.
While this reduced alertness has impacted nearly all drivers, this issue continues to plague our transportation system. <b>Solution : Our app contains
a sub-system to prevent drivers from sleeping in between</b>.

<h3>Problem : Traffic rule violations</h3>
<p>
Violating traffic rules such as red light jumping, etc can cause a lot of chaos on small roads as well as highways. Such cases result in a measurable increase in road accidents and mis happenings too.
<b>Solution : With the use of built-in cameras as mentioned above , the system can click pictures of number plates of the vehicles that are caught
violating traffic rules, the authorities can use them to processes challan(s) that can potentially make the streets much safer and pave the way to more 
organized traffic.</b>
